# Custom functions at AG.DPP

This folder contains a number of functions that might come in handy for use in our scripts. So far, it contains the following functions:

- `corr_ci`: simply calculates the 95% confidence interval of a given correlation at a given sample size
- `corr_evol`: analyzes the evolution of a correlation as a sample comes in along the lines of [Sch√∂nbrodt and Perugini (2013)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jrp.2013.05.009) 
- `mspd`: performs matrix spectral decompostion of a correlation matrix to retrieve the effective number of variables underlying the matrix 
- `randcorr`: simulates random variables that are correlated to a specified degree
