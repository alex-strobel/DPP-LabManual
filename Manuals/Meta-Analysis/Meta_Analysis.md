# Introduction

As with every research project, one tenet of conductiong a meta-analysis is that our procedure of doing so is described as transparently and replicably as possible. I am (by 2022-01-12) rather unexperienced in meta-analysis, but from my reading, the major issues seem to be: 

[1. clearly definded search terms for all eligible databases of interest (e.g., PsycInfo, Web of Knowledge, PubMed, Google Scholar etc.)(#search-terms)
2. further inclusion and exclusion criteria including
3. rules for documenting inclusion and exclusion
4. manualized coding schemes for effect sizes and study characteristics
5. choice of the appropriate software tool and analysis specifications for conduction a meta-analysis
6. assessment of potential moderators (i.e., meta-regression)
7. asessment of potential publication bias


# Search terms

Yet, (for me and so far) it seems that for meta-analyses, the transparent and replicable way of conducting them (e.g., via a predefined search term on PsycInfo) leaves one with far fewer eglibible studies for inclusion than some idiosyncratic way of browsing through hundreds of papers on Google Scholar, going through their abstracts, hopefully also their fulltexts, checking their references, then being reminded of some other study of a colleague where the research focus was different, but the variables in question were assessed, and then being reminded of own studies to which the same applies ...
