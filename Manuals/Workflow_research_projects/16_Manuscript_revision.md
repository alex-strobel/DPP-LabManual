# Manuscript revision

Don’t be too upset or angry about the reviews of your manuscript that will arrive after way too long timne since submission! 
They will most likely be not as positive as you expected.  
Adressing the reviewers' issues most of the time will indeed help you strengthen your manuscript!
Discuss the issues raised by the reviewers with your co-authors!
Pre-structure the revision process and then assign tasks to the other authors! Don't ask for help – assign tasks in a friendly manner and set a clear deadline, e.g.:

> Reviewer 1 asks us to perform analysis X. I guess, A has the most experience in performing X, so please answer this point in the manuscript and the rebuttal letter by {insert date at least two weeks before you have to submit the revision}.   
> 
Your rebuttal letter should address all issues in a structured manner!

<!-- add template for rebuttal letter -->

Thank reviewers for valid points, but don't thank for bullshit!
