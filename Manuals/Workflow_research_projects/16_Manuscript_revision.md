# Manuscript revision

Don’t be too upset or angry about the reviews of your manuscript that will arrive after way too long timne since submission! 
They will most likely be not as positive as you expected.
Adressing the reviewers' issues most of the time will indeed help you strengthen your manuscript!
Discuss the issues raised by the reviewers with your co-authors!
Pre-structure the revision process and then assign tasks to the other authors! Don't ask for help – assign tasks in a friendly manner and set a clear deadline, e.g.:

> Reviewer 1 asks us to perform analysis X. I guess, A has the most experience in performing X, so dear A, please perform these analyses and answer this point in the manuscript and the rebuttal letter by {insert date at least two weeks before you have to submit the revision}.   

Your rebuttal letter eventually should address all issues raised by the reviewers in a structured manner! Here is a template on how tp do so:

- add template

<!-- add template for rebuttal letter -->

Thank the reviewers for valid points and begin your answer to such a point by, e.g.: 

> We thank the reviewer for directing our attention to this important issue ...

or

> Thank you very much for your suggestion! Accordingly, we changed ...

Yet, don't thank for bullshit! If you think, a reviewer is wrong with their comments, be polite, but determined, e.g.:

> In our initial version of the manuscript, we obviously failed to make clear that ...

or 

> While we value the thorough reading of our manuscript and the helpful comments by this reviewer, we disagree in this point. {add elaborate justification why you disagree}
