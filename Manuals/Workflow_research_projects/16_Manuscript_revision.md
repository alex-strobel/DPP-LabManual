# Manuscript revision

Don’t be too upset or angry about the reviews of your manuscript that will arrive after way too long time since you submitted your manuscript! 
They will most likely be not as positive as you expected.
Adressing the reviewers' issues most of the time will indeed help you strengthen your manuscript!
Discuss the issues raised by the reviewers with your co-authors!
Pre-structure the revision process and then assign tasks to the other authors! Don't ask for help – assign tasks in a friendly manner and set a clear deadline, e.g.:

> Reviewer 1 asks us to perform analysis X. I guess, A has the most experience in performing X, so dear A, please perform these analyses and answer this point in the manuscript and the rebuttal letter by {insert date at least two weeks before you have to submit the revision}.   

Your rebuttal letter eventually should address all issues raised by the reviewers in a structured manner! Here is a template on how to do so:

> **Rebuttal letter**
> 
> We thank the Edior and the reviewers for their valuable comments on our manuscript. In the following, please find our point-to-point answers to all the issues raised (EP = Editor's Point, RP = Reviewer's Point, AR = Authors' Response).
> 
> EP1: Please formulate your hypotheses so that they translate into testable statistical hypotheses!
> 
> AR.EP1: Thank you for pointing this out. We now specify our hypotheses so that it becomes clear how we intend to test them (see revised manuscript, p. X, lines Y-Z). As an example, instead of assuming that habitual cognitive effort investment has a role in investing cognitive resources depending on task demand, we now state that we hypothesize that habitual cognitive effort investment (i.e., Need fo Cognition, NFC) moderates the effect of task demand (i.e., *n*-back level) on the investment of cognitive resources (i.e., pupil diameter) via an interaction term in a regression model (i.e., pupil diameter ~ *n*-back level * NFC, see p. M, lines N-O).

>
> RP1: I think that the hypotheses could be formulated in a clearer manner.
>
> AR.RP1: We fully agree with this point that also the Editor raised (see EP1). We have tried our best to better formulate our hypotheses, also by referring to the statistical method we intend to use to test our hypotheses (see AR.EP1). 

As you cannot be sure whether all people involved get all the reviewers' comments including your answers., it may be a good idea to reiterate what you have done, but keep this short:

> In short, we now specify for all hypotheses, what statistical tests will be performed to test them (see p. M, lines N-O).

<!-- add template for rebuttal letter -->

Generally speaking, thank the editor and the reviewers for valid points and begin your answer to such a point by, e.g.: 

> We thank the reviewer for directing our attention to this important issue ...

or

> Thank you very much for your suggestion! Accordingly, we changed ...

Yet, don't thank for bullshit! If you think, a reviewer is wrong with their comments, be polite, but determined, e.g.:

> In our initial version of the manuscript, we obviously failed to make clear that ...

or 

> While we value the thorough reading of our manuscript and the helpful comments by this reviewer, we disagree in this point. {add elaborate justification why you disagree}    

<!-- Also, often enough, reviewers raise minor concerns on issues that you can easily address and some major concern on an issue you cannot (such as collecting more data). Then try to address as many minor concerns as thoroughly as possible, even if you might see not point in doing so (e.g., adding some seemingly irrelevant demographic detail) as long as that does not weaken your manuscript (e.g., running a statistical analysis that does not make sense at all), and if you preregistered your analysis plan, you are safe anyway: all what goes beyond this plan, would be an exploratory analysis. ... -->
