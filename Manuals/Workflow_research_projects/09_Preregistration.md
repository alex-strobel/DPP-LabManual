# Preregistration

In line with the [OSIP Research Transparency Statement](https://tu-dresden.de/mn/psychologie/die-fakultaet/open-science/osip-research-transparency-statement), whenever possible and sensible, we preregister our main hypotheses on a reliable platform (e.g., the [Open Science Framework (OSF)](https://osf.io/prereg) or [asPredicted](https://aspredicted.org)). 
A very useful resource for learning about why and how to do preregistration is provided by the [SLUB](https://www.slub-dresden.de/):

- [Preregistration of scientifc studies](https://bildungsportal.sachsen.de/opal/auth/RepositoryEntry/31574065165/CourseNode/1628044732527501003)

It's an [OPAL](https://bildungsportal.sachsen.de/opal/shiblogin) course for which you need a login from a university in Saxony (for our team the [ZIH](https://tu-dresden.de/zih) login). There seems to be an option for a guest account, I haven't tried yet because of no need to have one ... 

**At AG.DPP, we usually prefer preregistration via OSF over AsPredicted.**
