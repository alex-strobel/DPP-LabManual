# Create a GitHub project

In order to efficiently organize collaboration on our research projects, we setup a GitHub project and a reproducible R environment using the `renv` package (with a little help from the `here` package). Read these pages to learn how to use GitHub and how to create a reproducible workflow:  

- [Setup GitHub](https://github.com/alex-strobel/DPP-LabManual/wiki/GitHub)
- [Version control and collaboration using GitHub and the `renv` package](https://github.com/alex-strobel/DPP-LabManual/blob/main/Manuals/GitHub_and_renv/GitHub_and_renv_short.md)

Now invite all collaborators to join the GitHub project via `Settings > Manage Access` (of course, they need to have a GitHub account).
