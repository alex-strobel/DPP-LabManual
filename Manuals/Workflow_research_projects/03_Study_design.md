# Study design

Parallel to writing down the rationale of your study, develop a study plan and a protocol. 
Try to anticipate as many details as possible! 
Specifically, follow the points below:

## Consider only variables that are really necessary and assess them in a detail that is justified!

Regarding what variables are really neccesary ...

- those relevant to characterize your sample (age, gender, education will in most cases do) to enable an estimation of the level of generalizability
- those relevant to answer your research question
- potential confounders (read this [interresting blog post on confounders](https://towardsdatascience.com/get-a-grip-when-to-add-covariates-in-a-linear-regression-f6a5a47930e5))

Regarding the detail of assessment ...

- for gender, male, female, diverse will do
- for education, most often two (Abi or not) or three levels (Hauptschule, Realschule, Abi) will do
- job will be mostly irrelevant for us

When planning a study with a large sample you may be tempted to assess as many variables you can in order to exploit the data set for a number of publications. 
What sounds like a good idea, may haunt you later on because

- you will need to report all measures in the study in every article based on the study (because in line with the [OSIP Research Transparency Statement](https://tu-dresden.de/mn/psychologie/die-fakultaet/open-science/osip-research-transparency-statement), we always use the 21-word solution ([Simmons et al., 2012](http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2160588)), which may be tiresome
- reviewers will ask why you only used a certain portion of the data for a given paper or may even suspect piecemeal publication
- having so many variables at hand may also be confusing and may tempt you run exploratory analyses or use covariates that were not planned to be included in the analysis

It is therefore most of the time wise to reduce the number of potential outcome variables and *a priori* covariates to a minimum **or** to write a Data/Project paper ahead of beginning data collection where you describe the larger project, the data collected and the intended use for different research questions and, thus, different research papers.
