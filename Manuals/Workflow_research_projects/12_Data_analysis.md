More likely than not you will not have foreseen all the issues your data set comes with, and you may want to change some of your preregistered routines. **Don't!** Proceed as preregistered and then perform additional analyses, making clear that these have not been preregistered ans therefore must considered as exploratory. As long as you are most transparent abouut what your are doing, everything is fine. Problems only arise if you later on declare something that you did not initially intended to do (or forgot to declare as something you will do) as something you actually did intend to do. As an example: You realize that in your preregistration, you forgot to declare that you intend to log-transform your reaction time data (whether this is justified, is another issue <!-- add link to manual on the appropriate treatment of RT data -->). You now might think that everyone else log-transforms RT data, so it would be stupid not doing so just because you forgot to preregister that step. Well, what is stupid is that you forgot to preregister this step, but it is not stupid to live with your error and to proceed as preregistered. In your manuscript, you would point out that error (if it is one, again, see <!-- add link to manual on how to appropriiately deal with RT data -->  and add (and, importantly, *mark!*) the analyses with the log-transformed data as *exploratory analyses*.
