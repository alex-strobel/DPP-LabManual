# Methods part

We at AG.DPP always start our Methods part with the [21-word solution](https://github.com/alex-strobel/DPP-LabManual/wiki/21-word-solution), and we make sure that it is correct. 

## Participants

The first subsection is the *Participants* section. You may want to start it with your power analysis that informed you about your sample size. 

> We assumed an effect size of *r* = .30. With a power of 1-&beta; = .95, the required sample size was *N* = 138 as determined using the R package *pwr* (Champely, 2020). We oversampled by 10% to account for dropouts, technical errors and outliers and therefore recruitied *N* = 150 participants. Of these, two had to be excluded due to technical reasons (EEG recording failed) and three further participants had to be excluded due to untrustworthy answers (e.g., age = 99 or gender = "Boba Fett"), leaving 145 participants (X percent female) with a mean age of ... years (range Y to Z years).

Or you may have had a convenience sample that for economic reasons was as large as it could be given a limited time to perform your study.  

> Due to time constraints, we recruited as many participants as possible between Oct 2022 and Feb 2023. A total of *N* = 119 participants (67 percent female) took part in our study. With this sample size, we were able to detect a correlation of *r* = .32 with a power of 1-&beta; = .95.  

In any case, describe your rationale for determining sample size. Ideally, this rationale should be based on power considerations, but sometimes, you will not be able to meet the sample size you ideally should have. Then, be open about it:

> For the within-subjects analyses, a power calculation using G\*Power (Faul et al., 2009) indicated a sample size of *N* = 36 when assuming a medium effect sizte of *f* = .25, a power of 1-&beta; = .95 and an &alpha;-level of .05. Yet, for between-subjects analyses, G\*Power indicated a required sample size of *N* = 136 to achive a power 1-&beta; = .95 to detect a medium effect size at the nominal &alpha;-level.
