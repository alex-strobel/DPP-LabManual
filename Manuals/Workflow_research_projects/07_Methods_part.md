# Methods part

We at AG.DPP always start our Methods part with the [21-word solution](https://github.com/alex-strobel/DPP-LabManual/wiki/21-word-solution), and we make sure that it is correct. 

## Participants

The first subsection is the *Participants* section. You may want to start it with your power analysis that informed you about your sample size. 

> We assumed an effect size of *r* = .30. With a power of 1-&beta; = .95, the required sample size was *N* = 138 as determined using the R package *pwr* (Champely, 2020). We oversampled by 10% to account for dropouts, technical errors and outliers and therefore recruitied *N* = 150 participants. Of these, two had to be excluded due to technical reasons (EEG recording failed) and three further participants had to be excluded due to untrustworthy answers (e.g., age = 99 or gender = "Boba Fett"), leaving 145 participants (X percent female) with a mean age of ... years (range Y to Z years).

Or you may have had a convenience sample that for economic reasons was as large as it could be given a limited time to perform your study.
