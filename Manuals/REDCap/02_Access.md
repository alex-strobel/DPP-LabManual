# Gain Access to REDCap

To use [REDCap](https://www.project-redcap.org/), your non-profit organization has to join the REDCap consortium. Luckily, the TU Dresden is member of this consotium, so we can use our own individual REDCap system.

To gain access to the REDCap system as a researcher, you must contact the ZIH administrators:

- [Manuel Schulze](mailto:manuel.schulze@tu-dresden.de)

Please note that you need a functioning ZIH login to use REDCap. If you plan to use REDCap with an external collaborateur it would be feasible to request a ZIH guest account for this collaboratour.
