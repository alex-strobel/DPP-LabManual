REDCap stands for Research Electronic Data Capture and is a fantastic tool to collect data for your projects.
You can access it via browser from any device at any time using two-factor authentication.
Its servers are hosted directly at each university that uses REDCap, so the data is safe and each account and project is managed by the respective university.
REDCap allows you to have basically your entire project's data all in one place, specifically:

+ Questionnaire data collected directly in REDCap
+ Other data files (e.g. physiological or behavioural) uploaded to each subject's entry
+ Meta data like timestamps, and even quick analyses of basic sample characteristics like gender ratios

Further, REDCap takes several burdens off your shoulders:

+ Fields cannot be left empty unless you allow it, thereby eliminating missings
+ Fields can have only certain ranges, thereby eliminating impossible values
+ Personalized invitations to online questionnaires are sent at time points of your choice and automatically re-sent if the subject hasn't answered within a set time window
+ You will always exactly know how each item was coded because you can export the automatically generated codebook with the click of a button
+ Items can be worded based on a subject's previous responses, eliminating the use of items like "Rate your passion for the ice cream flavour that was your answer three questions ago on a scale of 1 to 10"
+ You can create a project calender to schedule lab sessions with your collaborators
+ Export all data fields into different data formats like CSV, SPSS, XLS, etc.
+ ...

REDCap also has a complementary app for mobile devices like tablets, which works offline and synchronizes the data as soon as it has a wifi connection again.
This feature *would* be fantastic for lab sessions in the electrically shielded EEG cabin, but is sadly not available at TU Dresden at the moment.
But since the rest of REDCap is so spectacular, we shall forgive them.
