# Introduction

The [targets](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/) package is a pipeline toolkit for statistics and data science in R. You can maintain a reproducible workflow without repeating yourself. `targets` learns how your pipeline fits together, monitors your pipeline, skips costly runtime for tasks that are already up to date, and runs only the necessary computations.
