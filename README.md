# DPP-LabManual

**Lab Manual of the Differential and Personality Psychology group (AG.DPP) at TU Dresden**

<!-- For now, I call it the Lab Manual "Miranda" and the one who detects this pun is rewarded with a bottle of wine -->

So far, this manual is still under development and its contents have not yet been finally discussed and agreed upon by all team members. Still, it may already now be used for instructing new team members (e.g., master students) on how to use certain tools (see the [Wiki](https://github.com/alex-strobel/DPP-LabManual/wiki)) or perform certain routines (e.g., [creating a reproducible environment for collaborative work on research projects](https://github.com/alex-strobel/DPP-LabManual/blob/main/Research/Administration/GitHub/GitHub_and_renv_long.md)). One major feature of this manual also will be to elaborate on what we as a group agree upon when it comes to [organizing a research project](https://github.com/alex-strobel/DPP-LabManual/tree/main/Research/Administration/Research-Workflow).

This LabManual is structured along our three main tasks:

- [Research](https://github.com/alex-strobel/DPP-LabManual/tree/main/Research) (ranging from very general information on [how to perform a research project](https://github.com/alex-strobel/DPP-LabManual/tree/main/Research/Administration/Research-Workflow) to very specific information on [how to handle outliers](https://github.com/alex-strobel/DPP-LabManual/wiki/Outliers) etc.)
- [Teaching](https://github.com/alex-strobel/DPP-LabManual/tree/main/Teaching) (e.g., how to create an OPAL course, how to have your seminars evaluated etc.)
- [Administration](https://github.com/alex-strobel/DPP-LabManual-Administration) (e.g., what to do if one hires a student assistan, how to handle work-related travel  etc.; this is a private repository)
- 
So if you are a team member and know something about a certain work process, feel free to describe it here! And if your aren't a team member but want to comment on what is written here, please contact [Alexander Strobel](mailto:alexander.strobel@tu-dresden.de).

**Disclaimer**: What is written in this LabManual reflects the (most probably incomplete) understanding of its contributors. Often enough, the routines/suggestions/workflows described here may be idiosyncratic or the result of *our* reading of some procedure or another or may only apply to certain issues we came across, and sometimes (or in fact, most of the time), rules and regulations and even the usage of terms may have changed since we wrote this, either unbeknowst of or neglected by us. So please, do not rely on what is written here as it was written by some kind of authority. We all fail (some or most of the time). Rather, use the procedures outlined here as some recommendation amongst others, so in any case check back!
