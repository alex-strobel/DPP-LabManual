# Code of Conduct <!-- Don't know whether we need this ... -->

[Alexander Strobel](mailto:alexander.strobel@tu-dresden.de)

It should not be necessary to have a file like this because all of us will agree upon what will be outlined below. 
Yet, what we might think to agree upon may change over time and who comprises the *all of us* may change as well so that having a written *code of conduct* might be useful in the future.

To put it simple:

1. We are a team and as often as possible make collective decisions.
2. We embrace open science principles and act accordingly.
3. We always comment our code.
4. We adhere to common principles when using language, i.e., everything said and written should be as accessible and inclusive as possible. 
8. ...

To elaborate :

## We are a team and as often as possible will make collective decisions.

Still, for certain projects, it will be most efficient if there is one team member that eventually decides on how to proceed. This does not necessarily need but eventually often enough will be Alex. As Alex tends to postpone decisons, keep him reminded of his duty. Still, all team members can take part in any decision, but should also be prepared to do so.
