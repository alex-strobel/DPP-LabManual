## Introductory remarks

Mediation and moderation analysis are often used tools (not only) in individual differences research.
Apart from being regression-based techniques, these analysis approaches do not have much in common.
Still, both techniques are often taught together, perhaps because the authors that introduced (or elaborated on) them are the same, perhaps because both start with an *M*.
