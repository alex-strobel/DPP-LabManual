## Matlab

> MATLAB is a programming and numerical computing platform used by millions of engineers and scientists to analyze data, develop algorithms, and create models.
> ([Matlab Homepage](https://mathworks.com/products/matlab.html)).

Matlab is a license-based program.
The licence is very expensive, but as a student or employee at a German university one usually has access to a license.
Included in the license available here at TU Dresden is that you can update Matlab to the current version at any time.
Keep in mind that some Matlab toolboxes require specific Matlab versions.

## Matlab toolboxes

The functions of Matlab are complemented by a comprehensive package of toolboxes.
Some of these toolboxes are provided directly by Matlab and can be found either during installation of Matlab or later on the [homepage](https://mathworks.com/help/thingspeak/matlab-toolbox-access.html).
Probably the most important toolbox for us is the [signal processing toolbox](https://de.mathworks.com/products/signal.html), because it is needed for further toolboxes and analyses related to fMRI and EEG data.
Therefore it is recommended to install this toolbox directly from the beginning.

There are other toolboxes that are important to us and have been created by external researchers.
Examples are SPM for the preprocessing and analysis of fMRI data and [EEGLAB](EEGLab/eeglab.md) for the analysis of EEG data.
