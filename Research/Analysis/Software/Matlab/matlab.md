## Matlab

"MATLAB is a programming and numerical computing platform used by millions of engineers and scientists to analyze data, develop algorithms, and create models."
([Matlab Homepage](https://mathworks.com/products/matlab.html)).
Matlab is a license-based program.
The licence is very expensive, but as a student or employee at a German university one usually has access to a license.
Included in the license available here at TU Dresden is that you can update Matlab to the current version at any time.
Keep in mind that some Matlab toolboxes require specific Matlab versions.

## Matlab toolboxes

The functions of Matlab are complemented by a comprehensive package of toolboxes.
