## Introduction to EEGLAB

> EEGLAB is an interactive Matlab toolbox for processing continuous and event-related EEG, MEG and other electrophysiological data incorporating independent component analysis (ICA), time/frequency analysis, artifact rejection, event-related statistics, and several useful modes of visualization of the averaged and single-trial data.
> ([EEGLAB website](https://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/index.php)).

EEGLAB offers a number of advantages over the BrainVision Analyzer (BVA).
Especially the academic (free) use is an unbetable argument for using EEGLAB.
It provides an interactive graphic user interface, which makes it easier for new users, either completely inexpierenced or switching from BVA to get started.
An extensive, structured programming environment is offered for experienced users, which allows more flexible storage, access, manipulation and visualization of event-related EEG data.
