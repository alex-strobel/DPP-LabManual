# R, RStudio and R Packages

This folder contains manuals on the R environment for statistical computing, RStudio as its frontend, and a number of recommended R packages. Not all of the latter have been developed strictly for data analysis purposes, but in the broadest sense, they all serve the purpose of a reproducible data analysis.

So far, there are manuals on the following R packages you should have installed:

## Helper packages

- [`here`](https://github.com/alex-strobel/DPP-LabManual/blob/main/Research/Analysis/Software/R/here/here.md) flags some project folder as root so that all data and code of that folder can easily be accessed
- [`renv`](renv/renv.md) enables you to create a reproducible R environment
- [`targets`](targets/targets.md) is a pipeline toolkit that learns how your pipeline fits together, monitors your pipeline, skips costly runtime for tasks that are already up to date, and runs only the necessary computations
 
## Power analysis 

- [`effectsize`](https://github.com/alex-strobel/DPP-LabManual/wiki/R-package-effectsize) lets you calculate or convert effect sizes
- [`pwr`](https://github.com/alex-strobel/DPP-LabManual/wiki/R-package-pwr) provides the most common routines for power analysis
  
## Statistical analysis

- [`BayesFactor`](https://github.com/alex-strobel/DPP-LabManual/wiki/R-package-BayesFactor) lets you do Bayesian statistics for a number of tests including correlation analysis, *t*-tests or ANOVA
- [`lavaan`](https://github.com/alex-strobel/DPP-LabManual/wiki/R-package-lavaan) is the package to go for when you want to do structural equation modeling, latent state-trait analysis, latent growth curve or latent change score modeling or or even simple path analysis including mediation analysis
- [`psych`](https://github.com/alex-strobel/DPP-LabManual/wiki/R-package-psych) offers a lot of functions for individual differences research including calculating reliability and running factor analysis
