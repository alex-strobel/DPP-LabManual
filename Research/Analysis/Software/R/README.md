# R, RStudio and R Packages

This folder contains manuals on the R environment for statistical computing, RStudio as its frontend, and a number of recommended R packages. Not all of the latter have been developed strictly for data analysis purposes, but in the broadest sense, they all serve the purpose of a reproducible data analysis.
