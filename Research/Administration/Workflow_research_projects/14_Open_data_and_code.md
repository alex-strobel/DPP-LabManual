## Introduction

In accordance with the [OSIP Research Transparency Statement](https://tu-dresden.de/mn/psychologie/die-fakultaet/open-science/osip-research-transparency-statement) devised by the Open Science Initiative of the Faculty of Psychology, we provide open data and code (and all further material necessary to assess the validity of our results or to replicate them) *whenever possible*.

*Whenever possible* means that there should be an objective reason for not providing open data and code (and materials).

- For *open data*, one hindering factor could be that participants may be identifiable even if the data set is anonymized (which, e.g., would be the case if you conducted a survey among the members of some institute of psychology of some university in some year and would provide gender and status group as variables in your anonymized data set: it may readily be the case that there has been only one female professor in this institute in the given year).

- For *open code*, one would need to push their imagination really far to construct a reason why its provision is not possible.

- For *open materials*, the reason may be that we used some copyrighted est or questionnaire, and fo course, we cannot provide their item content along with out manuscript. Yet, it may be an idea to parapharase some questionnaire's items or to outline the general structure of test items.

Taken together: there may be reasons for not providing open data, code, and materials, but they are rare (the least so with regard to Open Materials if they are copyrighted) and need to be justified in the manuscript.

## Codebook

Also, we always provide a codebook along with our data. A codebook essentially is a list of the variables in the data set together with their variable and value labels, e.g.:

| variable | label                        | values                                      |
| -------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| age      | participants' age            | years                                       |
| gender   | participants' gender         | 1 = male, 2 = female                        |
| nfc_01   | Need for Cognition item 1    | -3 = totally disagree ... 3 = totally agree |
| ...      |                              |                                             |
| nfc_sum  | Need for Cognition sum score | possible range -48 - 48                     |

With such a codebook, we ensure not only the transparency of our research, but also make it possible that others can re-use our data for their own purposes.
