# Open data and code

In accordance with the [OSIP Research Transparency Statement](https://tu-dresden.de/mn/psychologie/die-fakultaet/open-science/osip-research-transparency-statement) devised by the Open Science Initiative of the Faculty of Psychology, we provide open data and code (and all further material necessary to assess the validity of our results or to replicate them) *whenever possible*. 

*Whenever possible* means that there should be an objective reason for not providing open data and code (and materials). 

For *open data*, one hindering factor could be that participants may be identifiable even if the data set is anonymized (which, e.g., would be the case if you conducted a survey among the members of sime institute of psychology of soime university in some year and would provide gender and status group as variables in your anonymized data set: it may readily be the case that there has been only one female professor in this institute in the given year).

For *open code", one would need to push their imagination really far to construct a reason why its provision is not possible.

For *open materials*, the reason may be that we used some copyrighted est or questionnaire, and fo course, wen cannot provide their item content along with out manuscript. Yet, it may be an idea to parapharase some questionnaire's items (e.g., for an Need for Cognition item, one could write: "Item x asks whether the respondent considers thinking as not their idea of fun") or to outline the general structure of a test (e.g., for a verbal analogies task, one could use the example item for this task: "Two verbal concepts are presented that have some relation, e.g., 'wood : trees', and a third verbal concept is presented, e.g., 'meadow' for which the respondent has to select a concept that has a similar relation as 'wood' and 'trees' from a set of five possible verbal concepts; here the correct answer would be 'grass'").

Taken together: there may be reasons for not providing open data, code, and materials, but they are rare (the least so with regard to Open Materials if they are copyrighted) and need to be justified in the manuscript. Simply saying "I am currently not in the situation to provide open data, code and materials because my contract ends in a month and I have to get this manuscript submitted" may not be a good idea in terms of Open Science (but it may be a good idea to state it exactly like that if your supervisor has done a bad job in ensuring that your working conditions enabled you to really engage into Open Science practices).

**Bottom line**: Whenever possible, we provide open data and code so that your analyses can independently be reproduced. Whenever possible, we provide the raw data so that other researchers can use our data to examine their research own questions (for that purpose, we will attach an appropriate licence to our data). <!-- insert a page in licence issues somewhere --> Also, we provide a codebook along with our data. Or, to put it another way: To provide open data withhout a codebook will be deemed bad scientific practce.
