# Project archiving

- Archive PDF of accepted and published version!
- Upload accepted/published version on ResearchGate if copyright allows!
- If you uploaded a preprint, add reference to official URL of the paper!
- Archive REDCap/GitHub/OSF projects (perhaps link your OSF to your other GitHub project)!
- Add ethical approval to your archive(s) and all further information and material necessary for re-using the data in a FAIR manner!
- Consider mirroring your project on OpARA!
- Reward yourself!
