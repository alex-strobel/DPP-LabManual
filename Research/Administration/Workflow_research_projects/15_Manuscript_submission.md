# Manuscript submission

## Journal choice

Usually, this choice should be made before start to write a manuscript because all journals have different requirements for manuscript creation in their submission guidelines or may even provide a manuscript template.
Now at the latest is the time to choose an appropriate journal for a given manuscript. 

The criteria for choosing an adequate journal are manifold:

- There are several generic target journals for our manuscripts because they deal with personality and individual differences such as (publisher in parentheses):
  - [Journal of Individual Differences](https://www.hogrefe.com/us/journal/journal-of-individual-differences) (Hogrefe)
  - [Journal of Personality](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/14676494) (Wiley)
  - [Journal of Personality and Social Psychology](https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/psp) (APA)
  - [Journal of Research in Personality](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/journal-of-research-in-personality) (Elsevier)
  - [Personality and Individual Differences](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/personality-and-individual-differences) (Elsevier)
  - [Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin](https://journals.sagepub.com/home/psp) (SAGE)
  - [Personality and Social Psychology Review](https://journals.sagepub.com/home/psr) (SAGE)
  - [Social Psychological and Personality Science](https://journals.sagepub.com/home/spp) (SAGE)
  - [Personality Science](https://ps.psychopen.eu/index.php/ps/index) (Leibniz Psychology)

- Some of the above journals have better reputation than others. Publishing in the *Journal of Personality* or in the *Journal of Personality and Social Psychology* may be more reputable than publishing in *Personality and Individual Differences* or in the *Journal of Individual Differences*.
- The aims and scope of the target journal should or course match your field of research in the broad sense, and virtually every journal has an "Aims and Scope" page, see here for the [Journal of Research in Personality](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/journal-of-research-in-personality/about/aims-and-scope).
- Sometimes the aims and scope of a given journal may match your field of research broadly (e.g., personality psychology), but it only rarely (if at all) publishes articles on your specific research topic (e.g., individual differences in emotion regulation), so you need to skip through the tables of contents of a couple of recent issues or search the journal - in this example for "emotion regulation" – to make sure that your topic has already been covered by this journal before.
- In case your manuscript describes research that follows up on a previous paper, it seems natural to consider the journal that published that paper as outlet for your research (unless its some top tier journal such as *Science* or *Nature Human Behaviour*, in this case, your research needs to be top tier as well).
- The journal impact factor also matters somehow. While the way scientific merit is evaluated is about to change for the better, quantitative metrics will still play a role for, e.g., hiring processes. So, if two journals have a similar scope that matches your piece of research, it may be a good idea to choose the one with the higher impact factor.
- Open access matters in any case, as we want to make sure to not only have our research disseminated as broadly and inclusively as possible. If you have a list of journals that might be appropriate target journals, and only one is an Open Acces journal, you should (all other things equal) choose this one. If therer are several Open Access journals, Article Processing Charges (APCs) may be considered. At TU Dresden, our library has funds to pay APCs up to 2000 EUR, you simply need to [apply for it](https://www.slub-dresden.de/veroeffentlichen/open-access-finanzieren). While most if not all of the above listed journals offer an Opan Access option, generic Open Access journals for our field of research are (among others):
  - [Frontiers in Psychology](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology)
  - [PLoS ONE](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/)
  - [BMC Psychology](https://bmcpsychology.biomedcentral.com)
  - [Personality Science](https://ps.psychopen.eu/index.php/ps/index)<br>
  

- Also, the estimated duration of the review process may matter. Some journals have information on the median duration of the review process or the time between submission and rejection or acceptance. There are also web pages where users enter their experiences with the time it took to review/reject/accept their constribution. Unfortunately, I just can find a link to such a web page ... <!- if someone has such a link, please insert it here -->  
- A not unimportant issue to consider is whether not only the journal, but the publisher of that journal has a good reputation. Firstly, there are established publishers who engage in questionable publishing practices, i.e., they will charge you, your funders or your readers (or all at once) with as many money they can get (some top publishers world-wide make more money than Apple!). Secondly, there is a vast number of so-called *predatory journals* out there that have no reputation, will print everything after a not so strict review process, and charge you with a comparably high APC. There are lists of predatory journals opn the internet, but some may be outdated, some may be biased, so simply search for "Journal Name & predatory" and use your common sense. So make sure that your target journal is not a *"bad one"*, and if in doubt, ask colleagues.

So your decision for a target journal should rest on the following considerations (to be weighted in this order):

- Does its aims and scope match your piece of research (e.g., because some similar research has been published there)?
- Does it have a good reputation?
- Is it an Open Access journal or has it an option for Open Access (and can you afford the APCs)?
- Does it have an appropriate impact factor (meaning for our field of research and IF &ge; 3) or (for newly established journals) is about to achieve one in the near future?  


## Publication guideline of the TU Dresden

Whenever possible, we adhere to the [Publication Guidelines of the TU Dresden](https://tu-dresden.de/forschung-transfer/forschungsinformationen/publikationsrichtlinien).

## Submission guidelines

As already mentioned, a decision on the journal you want to submit your mansucrit to, should have already been made before preparing the manuscript in order to format it appropriately. Yet, even if you consulted the submission guidelines ahead of manuscript preparation, you should now again go though these guidelines to make suer you did not miss some important instruction. As an example for such guidelines, see here 

- [Submission guidelines of PLoS ONE](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines)   

## Consider posting your manuscript as preprint!

You may want to consider to post your submitted manuscript as a preprint, e.g., on [PsyArXiv](https://psyarxiv.com). We usually do that, because:

- our research is made open (so especially for fresh ideas, you can claim that you had it first) and open for discussion
- the preprint is assigned with a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) and can be cited in other work of ours, even if the review process for the actual manuscript will take months/years 
- the majority of journals accept a preprint

Yet, to make sure that naïve readers of your preprint do not assume that it is a valid (i.e., peer-reviewed) piece of science, we at AG.DPP always put the following disclaimer on the title page of our preprints:

> Scientific articles usually go through a peer-review process. This means that independent researchers evaluate the quality of the work, provide suggestions, and speak for or against the publication. Please note that the present article has not (yet) undergone this standard procedure for scientific publications.

This disclaimer has been empirically validated, unfortunately, we forgot by whom ... <!-- if someone knows, please add ref. -->
