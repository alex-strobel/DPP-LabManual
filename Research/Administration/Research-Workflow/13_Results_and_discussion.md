> **Summary.** We always try to implement a common logic and order of arguments/analyses/results/discussion. If we state in the Introduction that we want to examine A via X, B via Y, and C via Z, we follow this order both in the Methods and the Results part and also discuss our results in this order in the Discussion part, ideally via appropriate subheadings that reflect what we have written in the Abstract. The Discussion part must include a "Limitations and future directions" and a final "Conclusions" section.

---

These sections of your manuscript should follow the same logic and order (that you should already have introduced in your Methods and ideally already earlier in your Introduction part).
As stated earlier, the overarching aim when writing a manuscript should be:
Take care of clarity and conciseness and get comments of your co-authors!
Specifically for the Results and Discussion part, the following might be of help.

## Results

As especially for very data-rich Results sections, readers may be drowned in this section, it is of utmost importance to adequately guide them through this section, to introduce in subsections what the analyses will be about and to sum them up before beginning with the next subsection. Also, if you comprehensively present your results in tables, provide statistics only for the main findings, but provide them comprehensively! As an example:

> First we performed a correlation analysis using Spearman correlations (see Table 2). Most of the variables were positively intercorrelated, all *r*<sub>s</sub> &ge; .17, *p* &leq; .043. Notably, the correlation between X and Y was significant, *r*<sub>s</sub> = .21, *df* = 254, 95% CI [.17, .25], *p* = .002, but smaller than expected .

Providing statistics *comprehensively* means that we always provide statistics with effect sizes or all information so that effect sizes can be derived. This usually includes to provide the test statistic including the degrees of freedom, standard errors and/or the 95% condfidence interval, a *p*-value, perhaps also - in addition to the standard approach – a Bayes factor.

Speaking of *significance* ... there is no such thing as a *marginally significant* result (e.g., if *p* < .10). If you *must* use the standard approach to hypothesis testing, you *need* to adher to its conventions, and even if some test comes with a *p* = .05002, it's *insignificant*. Just let the readers decide how much they give on your results ... 

## Discussion

Start your discussion with a short summary of the main findings before discussing them in detail. You ma also want to introduce your discussion with a (very!) short summary of your research objective and methods:

> With the present study, we sought to determine to what extent X relates to Y. Employing a robust method to correlation analysis, we observed X to be significantly related to Y, although with a smaller effect size than expected given the literature [@ref].

Then structure your Discussion section along the lines you discuss your results in the Abstract (or vice versa). One option could be that you use the statements made in the Abstract as subheadings of your Discussion. So if your Abstract reads:

> Our results point to a reliable association of X and Y. Yet, this association was smaller than expected. One reason for this result might be publication bias. Another reason might be restriction of range in our sample. Future studies should take this into account when following up on our results.

... your Discussion section subheadings could then be:

> **X is reliably associated with Y**
>
>...
>
> **The relation of X and Y is smaller than expected**
>
>...
>
> **Publication bias as one reason for our pattern of results**
>
> ...
>
> **Limitations and future directions**
>
>...
>
> **Conclusion**

In the single subsections, relate your results to what has been found before, cite previous studies on the matter and relate their results to your findings. Always have a *Limitations* section where you really should (re-)consider all issues that are problematic to your study and that could render your results as wrong. This will provide an agenda for duture research, both for yourself and other researchers. 

Place this section before a final – and also mandatory – *Conclusion* section that concisely summarizes what you said before. You may regard this as redundant, but it is absolutely necessary to end with a take-home message. And if you repeat your abstract, this is absolutely ok, (but if you find a way to paraphrase it, it would be even better).
