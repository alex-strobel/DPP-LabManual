# Data collection

It is strongly recommended that you use REDCap for data collection. See here for further information:

- [REDCap wiki entry](https://github.com/alex-strobel/DPP-LabManual/wiki/REDCap)
- [REDCap workflow](https://github.com/alex-strobel/DPP-LabManual/tree/main/Manuals/REDCap)

Continuously perform data quality checks:

These quality checks should definitely happen in the form of a **pilot study** before your main data collection starts.
By collecting data from 10, 15 participants, and writing your analysis script already, you can easily see whether there is something missing (some data is not being saved during the paradigm, a questionnaire got skipped, etc.), whether some of the data is outright bad (wrong thresholds during EEG measurement, data is being saved in a non-comprehensible way, etc.), or anything else that might be wrong.

Another tip is to **freshen up on your collection standards** from time to time. What this means is to have a close look at your session guidelines, your EEG preparation notes, and the way you are supposed to instruct the participants verbally every 20-30 participants. *Especially* if you are not the only one, but have research assistants helping you with data collection.
Schedule freshen-up-meetings from time to time to avoid systematic drifts and decline in data quality.

If using Bayesian sequential testing, continuously monitor evolution of Bayes factors!
