# Create a GitHub project

## GitHub

In order to efficiently organize collaboration on our research projects, we setup a GitHub project and a reproducible R environment using the `renv` package (with a little help from the `here` package). Read these pages to learn how to use GitHub and how to create a reproducible workflow:  

- [GitHub Introduction](https://github.com/alex-strobel/DPP-LabManual/blob/d6339c760487245704c18566b9e7c0300d4a0a4a/Research/Administration/GitHub/GitHub.md)
- [Version control and collaboration using GitHub and the `renv` package](https://github.com/alex-strobel/DPP-LabManual/blob/main/Manuals/GitHub_and_renv/GitHub_and_renv_short.md)

Now invite all collaborators to join the GitHub project via `Settings > Manage Access` (of course, they need to have a GitHub account).

## OSF

It may also be a good idea to also create an OSF project for your research, for several reasons: 

- Some people are familiar with OSF, but not with GitHub.
- You may want to post a preprint of your manuscript on OSF's [PsyArXiv](https://psyarxiv.com), see also [Manuscript Submission](15_Manuscript_submission#posting-the-manuscript-as-a-preprint). In this case, it may be more convenient to link your preprint to an OSF project than to a GitHub project.
- Also, the journal you want your manuscript submit to may have a double-blind review policy. If you host your project on a GitHub repo, usually your (user) name will be visible, even if you temporarily removed all other identifying information from the repo until acceptance of the manuscript. On OSF, you can generate a view-only link that masks all contributors to a given project.

The nice thing is that you do not have to create your project anew and upload all the files on your GitHub repo to the OSF project. Rather, you can link your OSF project with your GitHub repo. Every change you make on your GitHub project will be automatically mirrored on OSF. Read here how to do so:

- [Connect GitHub to an OSF project](https://help.osf.io/article/211-connect-github-to-a-project)
