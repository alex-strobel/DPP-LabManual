> **Summary.** You may alread consider the appropriate target journal for your manuscript, even if you haven't started the project yet. It also pays to consider in which format you want to write your manuscript. We at AG.DPP strive to use R Markdown as often as possible, for the reasons outlined below - and to use 
## Before you start

Two issues deserve consideration befaore actually staring to write on a manuscript. The first issue is related to the choice of the appropriate journal you want your manuscript submit to, for several reasons outlined below. The second issue is related to the form in which you want to write your manuscipt. I elaborate on both issues below:

### Journal choice

Usually, this choice should be made before starting to write a manuscript because all journals have different requirements for manuscript creation in their submission guidelines or may even provide a manuscript template.
The criteria for choosing an adequate journal are manifold:

- There are several generic target journals for our manuscripts because they deal with personality and individual differences such as (publisher in parentheses):
  - [Journal of Individual Differences](https://www.hogrefe.com/us/journal/journal-of-individual-differences) (Hogrefe)
  - [Journal of Personality](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/14676494) (Wiley)
  - [Journal of Personality and Social Psychology](https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/psp) (APA)
  - [Journal of Research in Personality](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/journal-of-research-in-personality) (Elsevier)
  - [Personality and Individual Differences](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/personality-and-individual-differences) (Elsevier)
  - [Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin](https://journals.sagepub.com/home/psp) (SAGE)
  - [Personality and Social Psychology Review](https://journals.sagepub.com/home/psr) (SAGE)
  - [Social Psychological and Personality Science](https://journals.sagepub.com/home/spp) (SAGE)
  - [Personality Science](https://ps.psychopen.eu/index.php/ps/index) (Leibniz Psychology)

- Some of the above journals have better reputation than others. Publishing in the *Journal of Personality* or in the *Journal of Personality and Social Psychology* may be more reputable than publishing in *Personality and Individual Differences* or in the *Journal of Individual Differences*.
- The aims and scope of the target journal should or course match your field of research in the broad sense, and virtually every journal has an "Aims and Scope" page, see here for the [Journal of Research in Personality](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/journal-of-research-in-personality/about/aims-and-scope).
- Sometimes the aims and scope of a given journal may match your field of research broadly (e.g., personality psychology), but it only rarely (if at all) publishes articles on your specific research topic (e.g., individual differences in emotion regulation), so you need to skip through the tables of contents of a couple of recent issues or search the journal - in this example for "emotion regulation" â€“ to make sure that your topic has already been covered by this journal before.
- In case your manuscript describes research that follows up on a previous paper, it seems natural to consider the journal that published that paper as outlet for your research (unless its some top tier journal such as *Science* or *Nature Human Behaviour*, in this case, your research needs to be top tier as well).
- The journal impact factor also matters somehow. While the way scientific merit is evaluated is about to change for the better, quantitative metrics will still play a role for, e.g., hiring processes. So, if two journals have a similar scope that matches your piece of research, it may be a good idea to choose the one with the higher impact factor.
- Open access matters in any case, as we want to make sure to not only have our research disseminated as broadly and inclusively as possible. If you have a list of journals that might be appropriate target journals, and only one is an Open Acces journal, you should (all other things equal) choose this one. If therer are several Open Access journals, Article Processing Charges (APCs) may be considered. At TU Dresden, our library has funds to pay APCs up to 2000 EUR, you simply need to [apply for it](https://www.slub-dresden.de/veroeffentlichen/open-access-finanzieren). While most if not all of the above listed journals offer an Opan Access option, generic Open Access journals for our field of research are (among others):
  - [Frontiers in Psychology](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology)
  - [PLoS ONE](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/)
  - [BMC Psychology](https://bmcpsychology.biomedcentral.com)
  - [Personality Science](https://ps.psychopen.eu/index.php/ps/index)<br>

- Also, the estimated duration of the review process may matter. Some journals have information on the median duration of the review process or the time between submission and rejection or acceptance. There are also web pages where users enter their experiences with the time it took to review/reject/accept their constribution. Unfortunately, I just can find a link to such a web page ... <!- if someone has such a link, please insert it here -->  
- A not unimportant issue to consider is whether not only the journal, but the publisher of that journal has a good reputation. Firstly, there are established publishers who engage in questionable publishing practices, i.e., they will charge you, your funders or your readers (or all at once) with as many money they can get (some top publishers world-wide make more money than Apple!). Secondly, there is a vast number of so-called *predatory journals* out there that have no reputation, will print everything after a not so strict review process, and charge you with a comparably high APC. There are lists of predatory journals opn the internet, but some may be outdated, some may be biased, so simply search for "Journal Name & predatory" and use your common sense. So make sure that your target journal is not a *"bad one"*, and if in doubt, ask colleagues.

So your decision for a target journal should rest on the following considerations (to be weighted in this order):

- Does its aims and scope match your piece of research (e.g., because some similar research has been published there)?
- Does it have a good reputation?
- Is it an Open Access journal or has it an option for Open Access (and can you afford the APCs)?
- Does it have an appropriate impact factor (meaning for our field of research and IF &ge; 3) or (for newly established journals) is about to achieve one in the near future?  

### Manuscript format

#### Word

The simple choice would be to write your manuscript in Word. The nice thing about Word is that you are accustomed to use it, that almost all journals accept or even *require* Word documents as manuscript files, and that it is easy to collaborate on Word documents by suggesting changes, adding comments etc.
If using Word, make sure to check out whether the journal you tentatively want to submit to has a Word template.
If so, it will save a lot of time to use this template from the beginning instead of having to copy your text to this template later on including all the hidden formatting stuff that will drive you mad.

The drawback of Word is that you cannot automatically insert results of your statistical analyses, but need to insert them by hand. 
This is not only error-prone, but also will be a great pain if you make some changes to your analyses. 
Then, you need to copy and paste all the results anew.

#### LaTeX

It is safe to say that LaTeX is to be preferred over Word, for various reasons. Still, it really takes time to master LaTeX. 
Nevertheless, to acquire some basic command of LaTeX language will always be a good investment in your scientific future, be it because yome collaborating group uses it, be it that you want to use R Markdown.
If you know LaTeX anyway, it will be a good idea to continue to use it for many if not all of your papers.
If you want to submit your manuscript as LaTeX file, again, check out whether the hournal/publisher has a LaTeX template you will be required to use.
Yet, the problem of a static document (where you need to edit all the numbers if your analyses change) remains.

#### R Markdown

Therefore, we at AG.DPP go for dynamic documents using [R Markdown](https://github.com/alex-strobel/DPP-LabManual/tree/main/Research/Analysis/Software/R#r-markdown). With R Markdown, you write your manuscript *and* analyze your data in one instance, and if you change something in your analysis (e.g., because being forced to do so by a reviewer), the whole manuscript is updated and changes of your results are updated as well, even in tables or figures. So, it is **strongly recommended** to use R Markdown for manuscript creation, and the above link tells you how to do so.

One of the problems you will encounter when using R Markdown is that changes or comments by your co-authors cannot be as easily handled as when you were using Word. Yet, we at AG.DPP use version control via [GitHub](05_GitHub_project.md) anyway for our projects, so this may not be a problem for all of your collaborators who also use GitHub. Still, there will be projects whewre you collaborate with researchers from another lab who do not use GitHub and/or R Markdown, and they will most likely require you to send them a Word document of the manuscript draft for them to review and revise.

Here, the problem starts, because while if using the `papaja` template for creating R Markdown manuscripts (which you should do!), you can render your mansucript as Word doument, but some features of your document might be lost which is especially true for more complicated tables (and be honest: your tables will be as complicated as tables can be!). One option could be to convert the standard PDF output of `papaja` to a Word document via, e.g., <https://www.ilovepdf.com>. This may work most of the time, but still, the changes and comments of your collaborators need to be implemented into your R Markdown file by hand, coparing the Word and the R Markdown file instance by instance.

A work-around for such cases is provided by the [`redoc` package](https://noamross.github.io/redoc/articles/mixed-workflows-with-redoc.html). Usually, you compile the output of an (`papaja`-based) R Markdown document as PDF via the YAML header option `output: papaja::apa6_pdf` (don't be afraid if the term *YAML header* sounds strange to right now; it will also sound strange later on, even if you mastered your first R Markdown document using `papaja`). With `redoc` installed, you simply compile your R Markdown document via `output: redoc::redoc`. This creates a Word document (although not in APA style as `papaja` does, but nevermind, this is only for communicating with your co-authors). This document can be send out for review/revision, and via `dedoc(docx)` (enter path and filename of the respective Word document instead of docx), it can be back-translated to a R Markdown file.

One drawback here is that mere changes are not highlighted. So if you, e.g., wrote "In recent decades, a great deal of research ..." and your collaborator changed this to "In recent years", this change will not be highlighted in the re-translated R Markdown file. Yet, if they made a comment, e.g., on the word "deal", this will be visible in the back-translated R Markdown file like this:

```
a great {== deal  ==}{>> perhaps better: body? <<}
```

So, while not perfect, the `redoc` package may still be of some help, because otherwise, you would need to compare a Word and an R Markdown document line by line by yourself.

## Formal aspects of your theoretical part

Take care of clarity and conciseness and get comments of your co-authors!
