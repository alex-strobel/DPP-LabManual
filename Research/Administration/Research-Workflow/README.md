# Research Workflow

This manual is at the core of this LabManual. It outlines how we @AG.DPP perform a research project, starting with the research question and ending with project archiving. It mentions all the things to do and/or to consider as well as the issues to elaborate on along the timeline of a research project:

1. [Pinpoint your research question and formulate your hypotheses](01_Research_question.md)
   
   It is absolutely essential to have a well-formulated research question, better think it over and over than to start your project with an ill-specified research question. Also, identify potential collaborators and discuss your question with them. One of them should be assigend to be the so-called Research Transparency Advisor, and all of them (but notnecessarily *only* them) will be potential co-authors of a manuscript that eventually results from your project, so make sure that everyone involved in principle *can* and actually *does* filfil the criteria for athorship.
   
2. [Write the theoretical part of your manuscript](02_Theoretical_part.md)
3. [Develop and refine the study design](03_Study_design.md)
4. [Create a REDCap project](04_REDCap_project.md)
5. [Create a GitHub project](05_GitHub_project.md)
6. [Develop an - ideally fully scripted - analysis plan](06_Analysis_plan.md)
7. [Write the methods part of your manuscript](07_Methods_part.md)
8. [Apply for ethical approval](08_Ethical_approval.md)
9.  [Preregister your hypotheses and analysis plan](09_Preregistration.md)
10. [Collect data](10_Data_collection.md)
11. [Preprocess and merge data](11_Preprocessing.md)
12. [Run your analysis scripts](12_Data_analysis.md)
13. [Write the results and discussion part of your manuscript](13_Results_and_discussion.md)
14. [Openly provide all data, analysis scripts and ideally material](14_Open_data_and_code.md)
15. [Submit your manuscript along with a preprint](15_Manuscript_submission.md)
16. [Revise your manuscript](16_Manuscript_revision.md)
17. [Archive your project](17_Project_archiving.md)
