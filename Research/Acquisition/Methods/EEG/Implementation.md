## Before
### What to prepare before the study

When preparing your study, make sure that you have the following points covered:
- theory-driven electrode placement (as there is no point in doing a 64-channel EEG when you are only interested in a small cluster of channels)
- the computer paradigm is linked with your physiology software (e.g. [BrainVision Recorder](https://brainvision.com/products/recorder/)) and sends unique triggers for all event types, so when looking at the EEG data afterwards, you know exactly when a stimulus appeared on screen and what kind of stimulus it was
- every necessary piece of equipment is functional and in case it suddenly breaks, you have access to spare equipment - e.g. borrowing something from another lab - so your sessions can continue until your equipment is repaired or replaced
- in the invitation/reminder emails for your participants, emphasize that they need to wash their hair on the session day or the day before, and avoid using styling products like hair gel, because this will impair the EEG measurement (they can wash their hair in the bathroom next to the lab after the session)

### What to prepare before each session

This is a list of items you will need for every EEG session:
- A fully charged powerpack
- An amplifier, connected to the powerpack and your physiology software
- A plugboard, connected to the amplifier
- As many electrodes as you need, connected to the plugboard (to make it easier for yourself later, avoid consecutive placements of the same colour)
- Cotton swabs, preferably one-sided and wooden
- Cotton rounds
- Antiseptic solution in an open container (about a third of a shot-glass is enough for one session)
- Abrasive paste in an open container (a dollop of the size of 1-2 hazelnuts is enough for one session)
- A syringe with a drawing up needle, filled with electrolyte gel and no air bubbles
- Plaster tape
- Measuring tape
- One plastic ring for each of your reference electrodes (exactly like the ones embedded into the cap)
- One adhesive sticker for each of your reference electrodes
- Tissue box

### How to inform your participants

Many participants have never taken part in an EEG study before, so your study might very well be their first EEG experience.
As a consequence, many are nervous because they don't know what to expect, and some even have misconceptions about EEG measurements (be prepared for the question "So, can you see my thoughts now?" - it comes up *a lot*).
So make sure you always ask them whether they have participated in an EEG study before, and adjust the amount of information that you need to convey accordingly.
If you want to cover all your bases, this paragraph touches on the most common issues:

> Today, we will record an EEG.
This means that I will measure the circumference of your head to pick the correctly sized cap, and then attach the electrodes to the cap and place it on your head.
It will be secured with a chin-strap because it is important that it sits in the right place.
The electrodes are passive ones, which means that they are only "listening",  they will not give you an electric shock or anything.
Then I will use the back of the cotton swabs [show the swab] to push the hair in each electrode hole aside, and prepare your skin with this antiseptic solution and this abrasive paste [show both].
The antiseptic solution is to clean and desinfect your scalp, the abrasive paste is to remove any oil and loose, dead skincells.
This paste contains salt and is like a peeling, so I have to apply a bit of pressure, and everybody's skin is different - if it feels uncomfortable, just let me know.
For some people, the paste is a bit irritating to the skin, but the vast majority of participants have no trouble at all, and you can wash your hair right afterwards, so don't worry.
When your hair is pushed aside and your skin is clean, I will fill the electrode hole with this electrolyte gel to bridge the gap between scalp and electrode.
This syringe looks scary but it is absolutely harmless because it is blunt, I just need it for precision [take the syringe and stab the inside of your palm with it, so they see that it really is blunt, a lot of people are scared of syringes].
We need to make sure that the electrical resistance at every electrode is very low, so they can pick up the signals from your brain, so all of these red dots here [show them the recording software on screen] need to be green.
This might take a while depending on your hair and scalp properties, about 20 to 30 minutes for a 30-channel EEG.
And because standing up with the cap would nullify all our preparation efforts, I would ask you to use the restroom before EEG preparation, so you can remain seated during preparation and the task afterwards. After the task, I will remove the cap, which only takes a few seconds, and then you can go over to the bathroom to wash and dry your hair.

And even if you have said all that, **always** ask the participant whether they have any questions, and tell them that they can ask questions at **any time**.

## During
### Picking the correct cap

It is absolutely vital to pick a cap of the correct size.
If it is too tight, the participant is uncomfortable and it will slide upwards over time, if it is too loose, it moves around and the electrolyte gel spreads between cap and scalp, creating bridges between electrodes that result in messy signals.

To measure the circumference of the head, place one end of the measuring tape on the forehead and loop it around, trying to find the widest point of the head while also staying horizontal (the dotted black line in the picture below).
Every head is unqiue, so if the tape is a bit lower at the back of the head, it's fine, just try not to angle it too much.
In adults, you will likely get a result between 54 and 60 centimeters, the most common one is 56.

Our lab has caps in four different sizes: 54, 56, 58, and 60.
A 52 would technically also be available, but since it has a smaller surface, it does not have slots for as many channels as the other caps, so check beforehand whether the electrodes that you need would also work with the 52 cap.
If your participant has a head circumference of exactly one of these caps, then pick that one.
If the circumference is in-between (i.e. 55, 57, 59, 61), then pick the smaller cap, because they are made of flexible material and the possibility of slight discomfort is still better than unusable data from a too-large cap.

### Connecting the electrodes

Depending on how many electrodes you have, this will take a few minutes.
It might be a good idea to take the participant's measurements early on, so they can fill out a questionnaire or do another part of the study while you connect the electrodes to the cap.
If you have electrodes in multiple colours, you can use the colours to make the process easier for you, e.g. if you put alternating colours in the plugboard but end up with two electrodes of the same colour next to each other on the cap, you know that you made a mistake.

The little plastic slots are only placed into cuts in the fabric, so you can rotate them to your needs, but you should treat them gently as to not damage the fabric.
Each slot has a narrow and a wide gap:

![Plastic slot with narrow and wide gap](Resources/Capslot.jpg)

As the electrodes are quite sensitive as well, especially at the "neck", the correct handling of electrodes and cap slots is crucial in giving your equipment a long life.
There are two good ways to insert an electrode into its slot: Holding it at its neck and pushing through the wide gap (ideally with you other hand applying counterpressure, mine was busy taking the picture):

![Inserting electrode part one](Resources/Capinsert.jpg)

...or by placing one finger underneath the slot and your thumb on top of the electrode, sliding it in:

![Inserting electrode part two](Resources/Capinsertremove.jpg)

If correctly inserted, you should hear a faint click.
*Never ever try to fit it through the narrow gap, never ever pull at the electrode cable, and never ever try to force the electrode in by pushing from the top.*

### Placing the cap correctly

Before you put the cap on the participant's head, you must ensure that the cap will be placed correctly (see head image above).
Take your measuring tape and place one end at the bridge of the nose, between the eyebrows (nasion).
Guide the tape across the top of the head to the back, feeling with your finger for the point where the scalp protrudes before curving inward to the neck (inion).
This is very pronounced in some people and very subtle in others, so it might take a few seconds to find the right spot.
Tell your participant what you are doing, so they don't think you're a creep.

Measure the distance between nasion and inion, and make a note of it.
Now you can put on the cap.

Since the cap has a tight fit and the material is quite slippery, it is a good idea to ask the participant to hold the front of the cap to their forehead while you pull it over the back of their head.
Now you adjust the cap's position by placing one end of the measuring tape at the nasion again and guiding it across the top of the head.
The slot for electrode Cz needs to be at the halfway-point between nasion and inion.
If it is not, carefully pull the cap forwards or backwards, and measure again until you have the correct position.
You can check the left-right-symmetry of the cap by standing on your tiptoes and looking down on the head from above, or by measuring along the top of the head from ear to ear as well.

Take a chin-strap to fix the cap in place, asking the participant whether it is uncomfortable.
It should be tight, but it should not hinder swallowing or breathing.

### Skin treatment

Now that the cap sits snugly on the participant's head, you are ready to prepare the skin, which not only includes the electrodes in the cap but also your reference electrodes.
Depending on your study design and preprocessing choices, you may have one or more reference electrodes aka ground electrodes.
We usually place two ground electrodes, one on the *mastoid process* behind each ear, which is a part of the skull that you can easily feel by pressing on the skin behind the ear.
The idea behind the placement is that the skin there is thin and has neither vertical neuron bundles nor great amounts of muscle tissue underneath.

Some of us like to place the ground electrodes onto the skin *before* putting on the cap, since the piece of fabric that is connected to the chin strap often covers the mastoid area.
On the other hand, the fabric is flexible, so some of us like to place the ground electrodes *after* putting on the cap to avoid accidently moving the electrodes, and they gently lift up the fabric over the mastoid area to prepare the skin.
Simply try what works best for you.

#### For the ground electrodes:
Take a cotton round and dip it into the antiseptic solution, then thoroughly clean behind the ear.
If the participant is wearing foundation or hasn't washed the area behind their ears in a while, repeat this step.
Take the dry part of the cotton round (or a new one) and dip it into the abrasive paste, a pea sized amount should be more than enough.
Go over the same area and apply a good amount of pressure, but ask the participant whether it is painful.
It is fine if they say "uncomfortable", but "painful" is a no-go, and everybody is different, so what is fine for one participant might be way too much for another.
It is also a good idea to wipe in just one direction, because trying to wipe back and forth with pressure usually just means moving the skin back and forth, which will not have the exfoliating effect.
Now take the ground electrode, click it into a plastic ring, and place the adhesive sticker onto the plastic ring.
Our stickers are too wide for the mastoid area of most people, and we want to avoid sticking in onto the hair, so simply take a pair of scissors and trim the sides.
Then you can peel of the sticker cover and carefully place the electrode onto the skin.
Take the syringe and slowly fill up the hole in the middle of the electrode, making sure not to have any air pockets in the gel.
The gel should fill the electrode completely without dripping down.
If the participant gets gel on their clothing anyway, let them know that it dries clear and washes out easily.

#### For the cap electrodes:
Take a cotton bud and use the wooden end to move the hair in the electrode hole to the side.
Be careful not to scratch open the participant's scalp, so they won't be in pain when you apply the antiseptic solution and the abrasive paste.
(If the participant has very straight and slippery hair, it often works better to apply a bit of antiseptic solution first and then move the wet hair aside.)
Then take the cotton end of the cotton bud and dip it in the antiseptic solution.
Clean the little area of scalp that you have just exposed, and use both a twisting and an angular motion to get into every (non)corner of the circle.
Take the same cotton bud (or a new one if the cotton has swollen up in size) and dip it into the abrasive paste.
Using the same motions, exfoliate the area.
Ask the participant about their level of discomfort and adjust the pressure accordingly, but keep in mind that the exfoliation is the crucial step for lowering the scalp impedance.
Finally, fill up the electrode with gel from the syringe, again looking out for any air pockets.
For the cap electrodes, it is important not to use too much gel, because depending on the fit of the cap and the hair structure of the participant, the gel might migrate underneath the fabric and create bridges between different electrodes, which messes up your signal.
Systematically, make your way across the entire cap, starting either at the front or the back of the head.

### Troubleshooting

Sometimes, you try to do everything right and the BrainVision Analyzer still shows you dots that are mostly orange or red (high impedance).
Here are a few things you can do (in no particular order):

- Check that you have clicked on the correct kOhm range (for EEG recordings it should be 0-10 kOhm). Having the bigger default range and red dots sounds counterintuitive, but the BrainVision Analyzer has done some funky things in the past, so don't be surprised if it works.
- Check all electrodes for air pockets in the gel, especially the ground electrodes. Move the gel around with the needle of the syringe or the wooden end of a cotton bud to make sure everything is air-free.
- Use a cotton bud to remove the gel from the worst electrodes and repeat the skin preparation there. Sometimes, the other electrodes will adjust.
- If one or two electrodes are really bad and the other ones are excellent, consider replacing the two with completely new electrodes, as they might be broken.
- If the orange/red electrodes are concentrated in a certain area, try to find the cause. Some people have patches of dry, flaky skin on their scalp, so what might have been enough exfoliation in one area might not have been enough in the other. Some people have a dent in their skull or a particularly narrow skull above the ears, so the electrodes in the temporal area might not be as close to the skin as they are in other areas.
- Get another pair of eyes. A colleague might see something that you've missed or has another idea of what to try to lower the impedance.

Throughout the scalp preparation and the troubleshooting, communicate with your participant.
Explain what you are doing and why, and have a chit-chat about the campus and their studies to pass the time.
Avoid highly emotional topics, e.g. anxiety regarding upcoming exams, conflicts with their flatmates, etc., so you don't introduce unneccessary variance into your data.

## After
### Cleaning at the end of each session

To remove the cap, simply loosen the chin-strap and pull the cap upwards.
Since you had placed the electrodes into the cap slots before putting on the cap, there should be no hairs stuck in the slots and pulling the cap off should be pain-free.
To remove the ground electrodes, hold the skin taut and peel the electrode off by the sticker.
Put the cap with the chin-strap and all the electrodes into a plastic tub, so you can get them to the sink without smearing gel everywhere.
Point the participant to the bathroom so they can wash and dry their hair.

Peel off the stickers from the ground electrodes and toss them into the bin.
Put 2-3 drops of baby shampoo into the plastic tub and fill it with warm water.
Make sure to drape the electrode cables over the side of the sink, so that none of the plugs come in contact with water at any point.
Using the same technique you did when inserting the electrodes into the cap slots, remove them by sliding them out with one finger placed underneath and one above, or pushing them out with a fingernail.
Take a toothbrush and thoroughly scrub every electrode clean, so there is no gel left.
You can place them back into the water until all electrodes are done, then rinse them with clean water from the tap for a few seconds.
Gently pat them dry with a towel, so you don't bend the cables at the neck, and hang them upside down next to the sink to dry.
Gently swoosh around the cap and chin-strap in the shampoo water, using the toothbrush or your fingers to remove gel where needed.
Thoroughly rinse the cap with clean water and shake off the excess.
Then flip the cap inside out and place it on one of the glass heads to dry.
Flipping the cap has the advantage that the plastic slots will be pushed away from the glass head, so when you flip it back to normal after it has dried, they are closer to the scalp.
Clean the plastic tub and place it somewhere to dry.

### Long-term maintenance of equipment

With constant use, the electrodes will get a certain kind of patina, despite cleaning them after every session.
So for long-term maintenance, it is useful to clean them using a glass fibre pencil from time to time.
This will influence the impedance and set back the systematic shift of data quality that you have across your study.
Depending on the sample size you might not want to do this at all ($N<40$) or after a certain amount of sessions (e.g. after the 50th and 100th session for $N=150$).

Take a plastic tub and place all your electrodes in there with the cables hanging out.
Put on latex gloves and a face mask, tiny glass particles in the air are not to be messed with.
Gently scrub across the sintered surface of every electrode with the glass fibre pencil, you should see an immediate change (greyish and dull to silvery and shiny).
Repeat this for every electrode and then rinse them with clear water and hang them up to dry.
