## Before
### What to prepare before the study

When preparing your study, make sure that you have the following points covered:
- theory-driven electrode placement (as there is no point in doing a 64-channel EEG when you are only interested in a small cluster of channels)
- the computer paradigm is linked with your physiology software (e.g. [BrainVision Recorder](https://brainvision.com/products/recorder/)) and sends unique triggers for all event types, so when looking at the EEG data afterwards, you know exactly when a stimulus appeared on screen and what kind of stimulus it was
- every necessary piece of equipment is functional and in case it suddenly breaks, you have access to spare equipment - e.g. borrowing something from another lab - so your sessions can continue until your equipment is repaired or replaced
- in the invitation/reminder emails for your participants, emphasize that they need to wash their hair on the session day or the day before, and avoid using styling products like hair gel, because this will impair the EEG measurement (they can wash their hair in the bathroom next to the lab after the session)

### What to prepare before each session

This is a list of items you will need for every EEG session:
- A fully charged powerpack
- An amplifier, connected to the powerpack and your physiology software
- A plugboard, connected to the amplifier
- As many electrodes as you need, connected to the plugboard
- Cotton swabs, preferably one-sided and wooden
- Cotton rounds
- Antiseptic solution in an open container (about a third of a shot-glass is enough for one session)
- Abrasive paste in an open container (a dollop of the size of 1-2 hazelnuts is enough for one session)
- A syringe with a drawing up needle, filled with electrolyte gel and no air bubbles
- Plaster tape
- Measuring tape
- Tissue box

### How to inform your participants

Many participants have never taken part in an EEG study before, so your study might very well be their first EEG experience.
As a consequence, many are nervous because they don't know what to expect, and some even have misconceptions about EEG measurements (be prepared for the question "So, can you see my thoughts now?" - it comes up *a lot*).
So make sure you always ask them whether they have participated in an EEG study before, and adjust the amount of information that you need to convey accordingly.
If you want to cover all you bases, this paragraph touches on the most common issues:

> Today, we will also record an EEG.
This means that I will measure the circumference of your head to pick the correctly sized cap, and then attach the electrodes to the cap and place it on your head.
It will be secured with a chin-strap because it is important that it sits in the right place.
The electrodes are only "listening", so they will not give you an electric shock or anything.
Then I will use the back of the cotton swabs [show the swab] to push the hair in each electrode hole aside, and prepare your skin with this antiseptic solution and this abrasive paste [show both].
The antiseptic solution is to clean and desinfect your scalp, the abrasive paste is to remove any oil and loose, dead skincells.
This paste contains salt and is like a peeling, so I have to apply a bit of pressure, and everybody's skin is different - if it feels uncomfortable, just let me know.
For some people, the paste is a bit irritating to the skin, but the vast majority of participants have no trouble at all, and you can wash your hair right afterwards, so don't worry.
When your hair is pushed aside and your skin is clean, I will fill the electrode hole with this electrolyte gel to bridge the gap between scalp and electrode.
This syringe looks scary but it is absolutely harmless because it is blunt, I just need it for precision [take the syringe and stab the inside of your palm with it, so they see that it really is blunt, a lot of people are scared of syringes].
We need to make sure that the electrical resistance at every electrode is very low, so they can pick up the signals from your brain, so all of these red dots here [show them the recording software on screen] need to be green.
This might take a while depending on your hair and scalp properties, about 20 to 30 minutes for a 30-channel EEG.
And because standing up with the cap would nullify all our preparation efforts, I would ask you to use the restroom before EEG preparation, so you can remain seated during preparation and the task afterwards.

And even you have said all that, **always** ask the participant whether they have any questions, and tell them that they can ask these questions at **any time**.
