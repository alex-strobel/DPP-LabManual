## Before
### What to prepare before the study

When preparing your study, make sure that you have the following points covered:
- theory-driven electrode placement (as there is no point in doing a 64-channel EEG when you are only interested in a small cluster of channels)
- the computer paradigm is linked with your physiology software (e.g. [BrainVision Recorder](https://brainvision.com/products/recorder/)) and sends unique triggers for all event types, so when looking at the EEG data afterwards, you know exactly when a stimulus appeared on screen and what kind of stimulus it was
- every necessary piece of equipment is functional and in case it suddenly breaks, you have access to spare equipment - e.g. borrowing something from another lab - so your sessions can continue until your equipment is repaired or replaced

### What to prepare before each session

This is a list of items you will need for every EEG session:
- A fully charged powerpack
- An amplifier, connected to the powerpack and your physiology software
- A plugboard, connected to the amplifier
- As many electrodes as you need, connected to the plugboard
- Cotton swabs, preferably one-sided and wooden
- Cotton rounds
- Antiseptic solution in an open container (about a third of a shot-glass is enough for one session)
- Abrasive paste in an open container (a dollop of the size of 1-2 hazelnuts is enough for one session)
- A syringe with a drawing up needle, filled with electrolyte gel and no air bubbles
- Plaster tape
- Measuring tape
- Tissue box
