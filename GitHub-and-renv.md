# Version control and collaboration using GitHub and the `renv` package

## Background 

Consider yourself in the following situation: 
You are working on a psychological research project that project involves collecting questionnaire data, behavioral data such as response times and error rates from an experiment, and physiological data, say, electrodermal activity (EDA).
You are collaborating with two team members. 
Your task is not supervise the project, to analyze the questionnaire data, merge it with the behavioral and the psychophysiological data, perform statistical analyses, and write the majority of the research report.
Let us call you collaborator A.
The task of collaborator B is to preprocess the behavioral data, while collaborator C will analyze the EDA data.
Both will be involved in writing the research report, as they will contribute parts of the Methods and Results sections and will revise your first version of the report. 


In this tutorial you will learn how to use GitHub and the R package `renv` for efficient collaboration on research projects including version control and a stable R environment. This will also allow to enable researchers to reproduce your research results using your data and code even if they use different R and R package versions.
